Greetings Earth

I'm a guy in my mid twenties who enjoys having a good time with a small group of friends. I enjoy playing games of all shapes and sizes. Board Games, Video Games, Card games you name it. I find it fasinating to explore how people play their games in terms of their philosophies, their resource management, and their dedication towards the pursuit of winning.
